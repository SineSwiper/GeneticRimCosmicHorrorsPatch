	<description>Extract DNA from animals and hybridize them to create new, exotic species!

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
- Adds eight hybrids between vanilla creatures and monsters from the Call of Cthulhu - Cosmic Horrors mod!
- Adds a new machine, the Eldritch genepod, to mix genes from eldritch abominations and create your hybrids.

&lt;size=24&gt;Load Order&lt;/size&gt;
- As with all patch mods, be sure to call it after Call of Cthulhu - Cosmic Horrors mod and GeneticRim mod, or else you'll get some errors.

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;
Made compatible with A Dog Said using the auto patcher: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=944381237
Should be savegame compatible and not break anything. Should!
